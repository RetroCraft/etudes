# études

This is an index of _études_, or short problems, used to practice and hone particular skills.

In particular, this repository grew out of a desire to separate out non-coursework from the [agony archive](https://agony.retrocraft.ca) (which contains course-related problems and study material from myself and my classmates) and put all the random quasiacademic sidequesting in one place. LaTeX files are compiled with the [`agony` class](https://github.com/RetroCraft/problems/blob/master/latex/agony.cls).
